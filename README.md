# InnerWorkings Code Assignment

## Usage
Build and run InnerWorkingsJobs.exe < input file path > < output file path >

Sample input, and corresponding output, can be found in the Sample Input folder

## Problem Statement

At InnerWorkings a "job" is a group of print items.  For example,
a job can be a run of business cards, envelopes, and letterhead together.

Some items qualify as being sales tax free, whereas, by default, others
are not.  Sales tax is 7%.

InnerWorkings also applies a margin, which is the percentage above printing
cost that is charged to the customer.  For example, an item that costs $100
to print that has a margin of 11% will cost:
item: $100 -> $7 sales tax = $107
job:  $100 -> $11 margin
total: $100 + $7 + $11 = $118

The base margin is 11% for all jobs this problem.  Some jobs have an
"extra margin" of 5%.  These jobs that are flagged as extra margin have
an additional 5% margin (16% total) applied.

The final cost is rounded to the nearest even cent.  Individual items are
rounded to the nearest cent.

Write a program that calculates the total charge to a customer
for a job (Bonus: Try to read the input from a file and output the invoice to a file).  The program should accept the inputs below and output the
total bill for the customer.

Use C# for the solution.

Include this problem statement with your solution.
